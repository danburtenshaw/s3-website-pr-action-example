# Example - s3-website-pr-action

This repo is an example [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application to demonstrate how to automatically deploy PRs to an S3 website using [s3-website-pr-action](https://github.com/danburtenshaw/s3-website-pr-action).

Take a look at the [workflows](.github/workflows) folder to see how the action is used.
